Stable Cookbook Checklist
=========================

Before a cookbook can be marked as stable (a.k.a v1.0.0) the following
requirements need to be fullfilled:

**Nagios Checks**
   All provided services need to be checked with nagios.

**Ganymed Collectors**
   Metrics should be collected with ganymed collector plugins unless the
   application logs metrics be itself.

**Splunk Integration**
   Applications without proper syslog support need to configure splunk inputs
   for all log files that are generated by the applications and services the
   cookbook provides.

**Dependencies**
   All cookbook dependencies need to be listed correctly in metadata.rb.
