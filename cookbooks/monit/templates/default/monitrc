## Start monit in the background (run as a daemon) and check services at
## 1-minute intervals.
set daemon 60

## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omitted, monit will use 'user' facility by default. If you want to log to
## a stand alone log file instead, specify the path to a log file
set logfile syslog facility log_daemon

## Set the list of mail servers for alert delivery. Multiple servers may be
## specified using comma separator. By default monit uses port 25 - this
## is possible to override with the PORT option.
set mailserver localhost

## You can set alert recipients here whom will receive alerts if/when a
## service defined in this file has errors. Alerts may be restricted on
## events by using a filter as in the second example below.
set alert <%= node[:contacts][:hostmaster] %>
